- All UI components should adhere to a minimalistic and futuristic aesthetic.
- Use a dark theme with neon accents (e.g., electric blue, bright cyan) for visual elements.
- Typography should be sleek and sans-serif, promoting clarity and modernity.
- Layouts must be clean with ample spacing to enhance readability and focus.
- Incorporate subtle animations to provide a sense of interactivity without overwhelming the user.
- Avoid clutter by limiting the number of elements on each screen.
- Ensure responsiveness across devices, maintaining design integrity on various screen sizes.
- Consistency is key: reuse design patterns and components to maintain a cohesive look and feel.
